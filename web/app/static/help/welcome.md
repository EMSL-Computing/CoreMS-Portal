####  Version `3.9.7.beta`  
  
## **Introduction**

The CoreMS web application was build to manage data, the processing workflow, allow visualization, and easily connect the results of the molecular identification of small molecules analyzed by mass spectrometric methods to data curation services. 

### Implemented Workflows
- Low Resolution GC-MS based **metabolomics** workflow
- Direct Infusion FT-MS analysis of **natural organic matter**, and **small molecules** in general 

### Core Functionalities
- Upload and manage raw data files
- Visualize the raw chromatogram and mass spectra, including FT-MS transient, noise threshold, etc
- Control workflow parameters
- Submit the data data processing, annotation
- Manage and visualize the the results
- Download and submit the results to curation services (Freda, etc)
- Upload the results to the data management service
